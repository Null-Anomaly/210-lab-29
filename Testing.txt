To unit test these various functions
my personal strategy is to put simple print out statements
throughout the code as it goes.
Each function will have an entry statement and an exit statement
Just a simple print function to make sure they were hit

Main portion of the driver program that does things

for(int i = 0; i < 25; i++)
    {
        randocool = rand() % 100;
        if(randocool <= 20)
        {
            event_Resolution(randocool, farm);
            cout << "Area 3a passed\n";
        }
        else
        {
            fruit_Change(farm, 0);
            age_Up(farm, 0);
            cout << "Area 3b passed\n";
        }

        cout << "Year: " << i + 1 << "\n";
        print_Trees(farm);

Does not include variables and the actual filling of the map list
But it does run through the various iterations that it can be.

I'm not worried about things working properly because if it compiles
that means it was able to actually read all of the data being sent through.
Compiling at all means there's no faults, all data is being read, and there's no errant overflows.

While this is usually a dangerous assumption to make, due to the data types that I'm working
with, it would error out if these things were not true.
