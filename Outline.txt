Sample Proposal

This project will aim to simulate fruit trees of various types as it may appear in an oarchard.
This program will label a random number of trees by a randomly generated ID. Each tree will
have the type of tree it is, the number of fruit it makes, and how old it is.

The objective is to simulate crop cycles for farmers, and when to replant certain trees.

How this will be done:

So first and foremost is the map. The first pair will always be the randomly generated ID.
The second pair will be an array containing strings. These strings will be made to represent
the type of tree, the number of fruit the tree had harvested, and how old the tree is.


Simulated events will include. Receiving fertilizer, Spray of prestecides, inscect plague,
droughts, and heavy rains. These random events will be rolled for each year/time period that passes.
