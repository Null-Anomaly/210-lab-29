Issues found when implementing beta version:

Bug 1: While it does output all values of the map list, it does not edit them.
Bug 2: It will run into a seg fault if iterator is not placed in the correct location
    for the number of items in the list
Bug 3:Issue where it only interacts with the first value on the list and does not properly iterate
Bug 4:The values aren't being passed up properly to the main set of maps
Bug 5: Age value from first ID is being passed to others when put through the event resolution function
Bug 6: Age values not tied to event resolution errors. Issues are elsewhere. Edit: 
    Error Found in age_Up function.
Bug 7: Issue found with attempting to return values to main function. Found to be unrealistic
    Moving all changes to maps to just the sub-functions.
Bug 8: Somewhere, it is going out of bounds.
Bug 9: Due to having made a portion of the code static in a previous version, it was causing
    an unexpected overflow
Bug 10:
